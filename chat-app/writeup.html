            <h2>Read receipts</h2>
            <p>
                I made read receipts togglable (i.e. if the user has them
                toggled off, then the app does not mark viewed messages as
                having been seen by the user. The "off" mode is dubbed
                "Incognito mode" in the app). While in incognito mode, the app
                displays a banner across the top of the chat window indicating
                so.
            </p>
            <h2>Replies</h2>
            <p>
                The reply system in my app follows Messenger's. (Well, most of
                the design for the generic chat app features and layout are
                inspired by Messenger.) In other words, users can reply to
                individual messages, but there are no threads; replies display
                the content and author of the message it is responding to.
            </p>
            <h2>Profile pictures</h2>
            <p>
                Users can change their profile pictures by clicking the
                "Settings" button in the top right, which opens a popup
                containing all the profile-related functionalities: names,
                usernames, and profile pictures. In chats, profile pictures are
                displayed alongside messages.
