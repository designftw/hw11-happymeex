                The problem that I set out to address with my chat app was the
                following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Users want an organized way to
                <b> view messages without revealing that they have done so </b>
                and a way to <b> schedule reminders for pending responses. </b>
                (During needfinding, I found that users often felt reluctant to
                open a message and read it since the read receipt would show
                that they'd seen the message and obligate them to respond. One
                result was that users would just not open messages and then
                forget to respond.)
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                To address this problem, I implemented togglable read receipts
                ("Incognito mode") and a reminder-scheduling system by which
                users can create, edit, and delete reminders for themselves.
                This solves the issue identified during needfinding by allowing
                users to open a chat in Incognito mode and then schedule a
                reminder to responding to the chat later. Though this was the
                motivating use case, my ultimate design and implementation
                became more of a general self-reminding system: users are given
                the option to associate no chat at all to a given reminder.
            </p>

                Features I added since the previous homework, taking into
                account my own vision, the feedback I got from studio, and the
                preliminary feedback I got on HW12:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The "remind" portion of "reminder scheduling". Last week I
                    implemented the scheduling functionality, and this week, the
                    scheduled reminders do in fact remind the user when the time
                    comes by opening up a notification popup. If the user is
                    offline at the time of the reminding, the app displays the
                    reminder notification on the user's next login. From the
                    notification panel, the user can dismiss the notification,
                    snooze the notification, delete the reminder, or just click
                    through notifications to view them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating new reminders associated to a chat directly from
                    the chat window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distinguishing between upcoming reminders and past reminders
                    in the UI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Persisting recent chats across page loads via local storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Small UI/UX changes like adding an "X" button for closing
                    the reminder popup, disallowing access to the channel with
                    empty channel name, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </main>
