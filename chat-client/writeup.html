                Currently, I have implemented a reminder-scheduling system,
                where the user can create, edit, and delete reminders. Each
                reminder consists of a title, description, reminder date,
                notification setting, and potentially an associated chat. The
                user can manage their reminders by clicking the large
                "Reminders" button, which opens a popup where all reminder
                handling takes place. For reminders with associated chats, the
                user can click on the chat name to navigate directly to that
                chat.

                This represents half of the core mechanics of the feature. As of
                now, the reminders are just "markers" that do not actually
                remind the user when the reminder date arrives; I plan to
                implement that functionality next week. Users will be able to
                either snooze or dismiss reminders when they arise. I also plan
                to make it possible to create a reminder by clicking a button in
                an open chat window, so that the user does not need to open the
                popup and fill in the chat info to make a reminder associated
                with the given chat.

                Ways the design differs from my Figma prototype: I removed the
                "Peek" buttons in the side bar and replaced them with a global
                toggler for read receipt visibility. This is more learnable than
                my previous design, where users would have to guess what Peek
                means (and trust in that guess the first time they try to read
                without read receipts). I also changed the display of the
                reminders in the reminder viewer by making the date and chat
                info visible (without requiring the user to click "Details") and
                by adding a delete button on each individual reminder.
